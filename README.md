# User manual, how I prefer to work and how to work with me

Prior to becoming a SWE I worked in a retirement home kitchen as a prep/line cook and also dishie, server, etc., for six years. SWE at its worst times is two orders of magnitude easier than food service. When prod is on fire, stakeholders are beligerent and the codebase looks like a hellskitchen pasta fiasco, that's Tuesday afternoon in a kitchen. On a Tuesday in a kitchen, my coworkers are brandishing knives at us, there's cockroaches everywhere, the guests in the dining reoom have dementia, for some reason the assistant staff hired to help in the dining room also have dementia, a few of the FOH staff are totally checked out but due to, reasons, the boss gives them the OK so you have to do 2/3x the work to cover. Is that an excuse or a story? More like an exuse, I'm working on it.

So if at times I come off as beligerent, uncouth, abrasive, whatever...that's where I come from. A kitchen. I can't apologize for my heritage but I can ensure you that I'm always working on my personal skills in order to work better with people.

> What drives me nuts?

RTFM attitude, ad hominem and general asshole behavior. This is unacceptable. If this is your preferred attitude, let me make it abundantly clear to you, **you will not work with me**.

When we don't strive to be people that we ourselves want to become. Don't cut corners at your coworkers expense. 

> How can people work well with me?

Before submitting work and thinking "ok...this is good enough", second guess yourself. Is it really? If you were reviewing, would you find a mistake? Do it for your team. Be the engineer you want to work with

> What are some things that people misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

In the past I have received feedback that I understand the theory of good management, but my personality is cold. I agree with this observation. I am introverted and having 5+ hours of meetings a day is exhausting. The real definition of introvert/extrovert is that extroverts derive energy by interacting with people; introverts derive energy by being alone and silent. So for me, having meetings and 1-on-1s all day is incredibly emotionally and mentally draining. If we are on a slack huddle at 6pm and I'm helping you debug something and I sound like a huge asshole, I'm really sorry. I try, but it's really, really difficult. Its not you, its me.

People also feel that I am very cold and ruthless when conversing on slack vs in real life. I agree with this. Maybe it's because how I grew up with online games? When moving my fingers to respond to some visual stimulus I see in slack, there is no personal connection. I have to slow down and think about the person behind the icon. This takes mental fortitude and time on my part, so I'm really sorry if I jump this step and say things way too direct or uncouth for your preference. You can help me by having a chat and explaing your own user manual to me :) 

> What do you care about?

Working efficiently, working to live, not living to work. Let's be efficient with our tasks so we don't have to work unnecessary overtime. 

I don't want you to work overtime, or get sick, or work while sick, or have to think about how many remaining days of PTO you have. As a manager, I will have your back, if you have mine, then I will do whatever I can in my power to support you.

> What's the best way to communicate with you?

Slack in either a pulic channel or DM. Email is for communicating with stakeholders outside the company, like our clients. **Text/sms is for emergency "the sky is falling" urgent issues only**.

> How do you like to give and receive feedback

In the style of Radical Candor. Directly, but not like an asshole.

> What's the best way to convince you to do something?

Provide irreconcilable experimental evidence (a test PR or POC), or back it up with supported research. Provide hard data.
